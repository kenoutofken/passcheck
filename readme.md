** README ** PassCheck: The Password Strength Checker  

### Introductions:  
PassCheck is a web app that allows users to evaluate the strength of their passwords in real-time. It uses JavaScript to analyze password complexity and provides immediate feedback through a color-coded strength meter. The concept and development of this project were based on best practices in password security and front-end development.  

### Instructions:  
1. Open the `index.html` file in the directory to begin the app.  
2. Enter a password in the input box.  
3. The strength meter will dynamically update based on password length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  
4. Toggle password visibility using the "eye" icon.  
5. Adjust the password until it reaches an optimal strength level.  

### Known Issues or Limitations:  
- The password strength evaluation is based on **pattern recognition**, not actual security breaches.  
- The current validation **does not store user passwords**, so it cannot check for compromised credentials.  
- The app does not currently support **custom password rules**, but this can be expanded in future updates.
